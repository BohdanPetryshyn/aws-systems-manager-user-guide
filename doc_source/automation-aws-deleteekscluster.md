# AWS\-DeleteEKSCluster<a name="automation-aws-deleteekscluster"></a>

**Description**

This runbook deletes the resources associated with an Amazon EKS cluster, including node groups and Fargate profiles\. Optionally, you can choose to delete all self\-managed nodes, the AWS CloudFormation stacks used to create the nodes, and the VPC CloudFormation stack for your cluster\. For more information about deleting a cluster, see [Deleting a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/delete-cluster.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*\. 

**Note**  
If you have active services in your cluster that are associated with a load balancer, you must delete those services before deleting the cluster\. If you don't, the system can't delete the load balancers\. Use the following procedure to find and delete services before you run the AWS\-DeleteEKSCluster runbook\.

**To locate and delete services in your cluster**

1. Install the Kubernetes command line utility, `kubectl`\. For more information, see [Installing kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html) in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*\.

1. Run the following command to list all services running in your cluster\.

   ```
   kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
   ```

1. Run the following command to delete any services that have an associated EXTERNAL\-IP value\. These services are fronted by a load balancer, and you must delete them in Kubernetes to allow the load balancer and associated resources to be properly released\.

   ```
   kubectl delete svc service-name
   ```

You can now run the AWS\-DeleteEKSCluster runbook\.
