# Working with runbooks for applications<a name="application-manager-working-runbooks"></a>

You can remediate issues with AWS resources from Application Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, by using Systems Manager Automation runbooks\. When you choose **Start runbook** from an Application Manager application or cluster, the system displays a filtered list of runbooks based on the type of resources in your application or cluster\. When you choose the runbook you want to start, Systems Manager opens the **Execute automation document** page\. 

**Before you begin**  
Before you start a runbook from Application Manager, do the following:
+ Verify that you have the correct permissions for starting runbooks\. For more information, see [Setting up Automation](automation-setup.md)\. 
+ Review the Automation procedure documentation about starting runbooks\. For more information, see [Working with automations](automation-working.md)\.
+ If you intend to start runbooks on multiple resources at one time, review the documentation about using targets and rate controls\. For more information, see [Running automations that use targets and rate controls](automation-working-targets-and-rate-controls.md)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Application Manager**\.
