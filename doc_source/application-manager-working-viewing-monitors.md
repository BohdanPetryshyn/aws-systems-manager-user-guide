+ Choose the **Actions** menu to view alarm data **Override** options, which include the following:
  + Choose whether your widget displays live data\. Live data is data published within the last minute that has not been fully aggregated\. If live data is turned off, only data points with an aggregation period of at least one minute in the past are shown\. For example, when using 5\-minute periods, the data point for 12:35 would be aggregated from 12:35 to 12:40, and displayed at 12:41\.

    If live data is turned on, the most recent data point is shown as soon as any data is published in the corresponding aggregation interval\. Each time you refresh the display, the most recent data point may change as new data within that aggregation period is published\.
  + Specify a time period for live data\.
  + Link the charts in the **Recent alarms** section, so that when you zoom in or zoom out on one chart, the other chart zooms in or zooms out at the same time\. You can unlink charts to limit zoom to one chart\. 
  + Hide Auto Scaling alarms\.
