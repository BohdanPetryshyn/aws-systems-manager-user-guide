# Identifying out\-of\-compliance instances<a name="patch-compliance-identify"></a>

Out\-of\-compliance instances are identified when either of two AWS Systems Manager documents \(SSM documents\) are run\. These SSM documents reference the appropriate patch baseline for each instance in Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. They then evaluate the patch state of the instance and then make compliance results available to you\.

There are two SSM documents that are used to identify or update out\-of\-compliance instances: `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` and `AWS-RunPatchBaselineAssociation`\. Each one is used by different processes, and their compliance results are available through different channels\. The following table outlines the differences between these documents\.

**Note**  
Patch compliance data from Patch Manager can be sent to AWS Security Hub\. Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your high\-priority security alerts and compliance status\. It also monitors the patching status of your fleet\. For more information, see [ AWS Security Hub integration with Patch Manager](patch-manager-security-hub-integration.md)\. 


|  | `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` | `AWS-RunPatchBaselineAssociation` | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Processes that use the document |  **Patch on demand** \- You can scan or patch instances on demand using the **Patch now** option\. For information, see [Patching instances on demand \(console\)](patch-on-demand.md)\. **Patch Manager patching configuration** – You can create a patching configuration that includes a maintenance window to scan instances for patch compliance on a schedule\. For information, see [Creating a patching configuration \(console\)](create-patching-configuration.md)\. **Run a command** – You can manually run `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` in an operation in Run Command, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. For information, see [Running commands from the console](rc-console.md)\. **Maintenance window** – You can create a maintenance window that uses the SSM document `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` in a Run Command task type\. For information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a maintenance window for patching \(console\)](sysman-patch-mw-console.md)\.  |  **Systems Manager [Quick Setup](systems-manager-quick-setup.md)** – You can configure Quick Setup, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to use Patch Manager to scan your managed instances for patch compliance each day\. For information, see [Quick Setup Host Management](quick-setup-host-management.md) in the topic [AWS Systems Manager Quick Setup](systems-manager-quick-setup.md)\. **Systems Manager [Explorer](Explorer.md)** – When you allow Explorer, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, it regularly scans your managed instances for patch compliance and reports results in the Explorer dashboard\.  | 
| Format of the patch scan result data |  After `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` runs, Patch Manager sends an `AWS:PatchSummary` object to Inventory, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\.  |  After `AWS-RunPatchBaselineAssociation` runs, Patch Manager sends an `AWS:ComplianceItem` object to Systems Manager Inventory\.  | 
| Viewing patch compliance reports in the console |  You can view patch compliance information for processes that use `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` in [Systems Manager Configuration Compliance](systems-manager-compliance.md) and [Managed Instances](managed_instances.md)\. For more information, see [Viewing patch compliance results \(console\)](viewing-patch-compliance-results.md)\.  |  If you use Quick Setup to scan your managed instances for patch compliance, you can see the compliance report in [Systems Manager State Manager](systems-manager-state.md), which is accessible using a **View results** button in Quick Setup\. If you use Explorer to scan your managed instances for patch compliance, you can see the compliance report in both Explorer and [Systems Manager OpsCenter](OpsCenter.md)\.  | 
| AWS CLI commands for viewing patch compliance results |  For processes that use `AWS-RunPatchBaseline`, you can use the following AWS CLI commands to view summary information about patches on an instance\. [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-compliance-identify.html)  |  For processes that use `AWS-RunPatchBaselineAssociation`, you can use the following AWS CLI command to view summary information about patches on an instance\. [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-compliance-identify.html)  | 
| Patching operations |  For processes that use `AWS-RunPatchBaseline`, you specify whether you want the operation to run a `Scan` operation only, or a `Scan and install` operation\. If your goal is to identify out\-of\-compliance instances and not remediate them, run only a `Scan` operation\.  | Quick Setup and Explorer processes, which use AWS\-RunPatchBaselineAssociation, run only a Scan operation\. |
