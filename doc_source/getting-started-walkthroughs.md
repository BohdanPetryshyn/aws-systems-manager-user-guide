# Step 3: Try Systems Manager tutorials and walkthroughs<a name="getting-started-walkthroughs"></a>

This topic guides you to tutorials, walkthroughs, and basic tasks to help you learn how to use Systems Manager\.

Because Systems Manager is a collection of several capabilities, no single walkthrough or tutorial can introduce the entire service\. Therefore, we've provided links to resources according to the capability for which they provide practice\.

In most cases, you do not need to complete additional setup or configuration tasks before you start\. You can complete all of the tasks if you have necessary permissions and, where needed, access to one or more managed instances\.

In some cases, additional configuration, setup, or experience with Systems Manager are required before you try a tutorial or walkthrough\. We have identify those tutorials and walkthroughs as "Advanced"\.
