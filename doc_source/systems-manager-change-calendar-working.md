# Working with Change Calendar<a name="systems-manager-change-calendar-working"></a>

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to add, manage, or delete entries in Change Calendar, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. You can also import events from supported third\-party calendar providers by importing an iCalendar \(`.ics`\) file that you exported from the source calendar\. And, you can use the `GetCalendarState` API operation or the `get-calendar-state` AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command to get information about the state of Change Calendar at a specific time\.
