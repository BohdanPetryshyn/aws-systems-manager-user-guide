# Systems Manager Automation runbook reference<a name="automation-documents-reference"></a>

To help you get started quickly, AWS Systems Manager provides pre\-defined runbooks\. These runbooks are maintained by Amazon Web Services, AWS Support, and AWS Config\. The runbook reference describes each of the predefined runbooks provided by Systems Manager, AWS Support, and AWS Config\.

**Important**  
If you run an automation workflow that invokes other services by using an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service role, be aware that the service role must be configured with permission to invoke those services\. This requirement applies to all AWS Automation runbooks \(`AWS-*` runbooks\) such as the `AWS-ConfigureS3BucketLogging`, `AWS-CreateDynamoDBBackup`, and `AWS-RestartEC2Instance` runbooks, to name a few\. This requirement also applies to any custom Automation runbooks you create that invoke other AWS services by using actions that call other services\. For example, if you use the `aws:executeAwsApi`, `aws:createStack`, or `aws:copyImage` actions, then you must configure the service role with permission to invoke those services\. You can enable permissions to other AWS services by adding an IAM inline policy to the role\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Add an Automation inline policy to invoke other AWS services](automation-permissions.md#automation-role-add-inline-policy)\.
