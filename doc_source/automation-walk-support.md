# Using AWS Support self\-service automations<a name="automation-walk-support"></a>

This section describes how to use some of the self\-service automations created by the AWS Support team\. These automations help you manage your AWS resources\.

**Support Automation Workflows**  
Support Automation Workflows \(SAW\) are automation runbooks written and maintained by the AWS Support team\. These runbooks help you troubleshoot common issues with your AWS resources, proactively monitor and identify network issues, collect and analyze logs, and more\.

SAW runbooks use the **AWSSupport** prefix\. For example, [AWSSupport\-ActivateWindowsWithAmazonLicense](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-activatewindowswithamazonlicense.html)\.

Additionally, AWS Enterprise and Business Support customers also have access to runbooks that use the **AWSPremiumSupport** prefix\. For example, [AWSPremiumSupport\-TroubleshootEC2DiskUsage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awspremiumsupport-troubleshootEC2diskusage.html)\.
