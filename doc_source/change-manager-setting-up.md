# Setting up Change Manager<a name="change-manager-setting-up"></a>

You can use Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to manage changes for an entire organization, as configured in AWS Organizations, or for a single AWS account\. 

If you are using Change Manager with an organization, begin with the topic [Setting up Change Manager for an organization \(management account\)](change-manager-organization-setup.md), and then proceed to [Configuring Change Manager options and best practices](change-manager-account-setup.md)\.

If you are using Change Manager with a single account, proceed directly to [Configuring Change Manager options and best practices](change-manager-account-setup.md)\.

**Note**  
If you begin using Change Manager with a single account, but that account is later added to an organizational unit for which Change Manager is enabled, your single account settings are disregarded\.
