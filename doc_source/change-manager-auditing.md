# Auditing and logging Change Manager activity<a name="change-manager-auditing"></a>

You can audit activity in Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, by using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail alarms\.

For more information about auditing and logging options for Systems Manager, see [Monitoring AWS Systems Manager](monitoring.md)\.

## Audit Change Manager activity using CloudWatch alarms<a name="change-manager-logging-auditing-alarms"></a>

You can configure and assign a CloudWatch alarm to a change template\. If any conditions defined in the alarm are met, the actions specified for the alarm are taken\. In the alarm configuration, you can specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic to notify when an alarm condition is met\. 

For information about creating a Change Manager template, see [Working with change templates](change-templates.md)\.

For information about creating CloudWatch alarms, see [Using CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

## Audit Change Manager activity using CloudTrail<a name="change-manager-logging-auditing-cloudtrail"></a>

CloudTrail captures API calls made in the Systems Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and the Systems Manager SDK\. You can view the information in the CloudTrail console or in an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket, where it's stored\. One bucket is used for all CloudTrail logs for your account\.

Logs of Change Manager actions show change template document creation, change template and change request approvals and rejections, activity generated by Automation runbooks, and more\. For more information about viewing and using CloudTrail logs of Systems Manager activity, see [Logging AWS Systems Manager API calls with AWS CloudTrail](monitoring-cloudtrail-logs.md)\.
