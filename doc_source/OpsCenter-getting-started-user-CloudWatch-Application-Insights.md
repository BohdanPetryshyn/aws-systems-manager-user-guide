OpsCenter is integrated with CloudWatch Application Insights for \.NET and SQL Server\. CloudWatch Application Insights helps you monitor your applications that use Amazon EC2 instances along with other application resources\. This capability identifies and sets up key metrics, logs, and alarms across your application resources and technology stack\. This capability also creates automated dashboards for detected problems\. Dashboards include correlated metric anomalies, log errors, and other information to help you determine the root cause of the erros\. When you configure application resources in CloudWatch Application Insights, you can choose to have the system create OpsItems in OpsCenter when problems are detected\. For information, see [Setting Up Your Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/appinsights-setting-up.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
