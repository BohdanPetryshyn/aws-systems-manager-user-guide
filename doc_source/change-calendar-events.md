# Creating and managing events in Change Calendar<a name="change-calendar-events"></a>

After you create a calendar in AWS Systems Manager Change Calendar, you can create, update, and delete events that are included in your open or closed calendar\. Change Calendar is a capability of AWS Systems Manager\.

**Tip**  
As an alternative to creating events directly in the Systems Manager console, you can import an iCalendar \(`.ics`\) file from a supported third\-party calendar application\. For information, see [Importing and managing events from third\-party calendars](third-party-events.md)\.
