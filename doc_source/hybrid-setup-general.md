If you haven't already done so, complete the following general setup steps for AWS Systems Manager:
+ To create an AWS account and an administrative user, see [General setup](setting_up_prerequisites.md)\.
+ To create users with permissions that are limited to Systems Manager, see [ Create non\-Admin IAM users and groups for Systems Manager](setup-create-iam-user.md)\.
+ To improve the security posture of your managed instances, see [\(Recommended\) Create a VPC endpoint](setup-create-vpc.md)\.

The other steps in the [Setting up AWS Systems Manager for EC2 instances](systems-manager-setting-up-ec2.md) section are required only if you plan to manage Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances\.

After you complete the general setup steps, continue to [Step 2: Create an IAM service role for a hybrid environment](sysman-service-role.md)\.
