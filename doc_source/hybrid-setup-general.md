+ To create an AWS account and an administrative user, see [General setup](setting_up_prerequisites.md)\.
+ To improve the security posture of your managed instances, see [Create VPC endpoints](setup-create-vpc.md)\.

The other steps in the [Setting up AWS Systems Manager for EC2 instances](systems-manager-setting-up-ec2.md) section are required only if you plan to manage Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances\.
