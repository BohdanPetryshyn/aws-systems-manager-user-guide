# Configuring instance tiers<a name="systems-manager-managed-instances-tiers"></a>

AWS Systems Manager offers a standard\-instances tier and an advanced\-instances tier for servers, edge devices, and VMs in a hybrid environment\. The standard\-instances tier lets you register a maximum of 1,000 on\-premises machines per AWS account per AWS Region\. If you need to register more than 1,000 on\-premises machines in a single account and Region, then use the advanced\-instances tier\. You can activate as many managed nodes in a hybrid environment as you like in the advanced\-instances tier\. However, all Systems Manager managed nodes that use the managed\-instance activation process described in [Create a managed\-instance activation for a hybrid environment](sysman-managed-instance-activation.md) are made available on a pay\-per\-use basis\. This also applies to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances that use a Systems Manager on\-premises activation \(which isn't a common scenario\)\.

As long as your AWS account and Region has fewer than 1,000 on\-premises instances in your hybrid environment, you can revert back to the standard\-instances tier at any time\. You can have up to 1,000 standard instances per account per AWS Region at no additional cost\. If you run advanced instances, you are charged based on the number of advanced instances activated as Systems Manager managed instances and the hours those instances are running\. Review pricing details for advanced instances\. Advanced instances are an account\-level feature\. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/)\.
