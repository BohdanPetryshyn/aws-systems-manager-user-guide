# Working with change requests<a name="change-requests"></a>

A change request is a request in Change Manager to run an Automation runbook that updates one or more resources in your AWS or on\-premises environments\. A change request is created using a change template\.

When you create a change request in Change Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, one or more approvers in your organization or account must review and approve the request\. Without the required approvals, the runbook workflow, which makes the changes you request, isn't permitted to run\.
