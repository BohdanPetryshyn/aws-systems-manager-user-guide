# Getting started with OpsCenter<a name="OpsCenter-getting-started"></a>

Set up for AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter is integrated with set up for AWS Systems Manager Explorer\. Explorer is a customizable operations dashboard that reports information about your AWS resources\. Explorer displays an aggregated view of operations data \(OpsData\) for your AWS accounts and across AWS Regions\. In Explorer, OpsData includes metadata about your EC2 instances, patch compliance details, and operational work items \(OpsItems\)\. Explorer provides context about how OpsItems are distributed across your business units or applications, how they trend over time, and how they vary by category\. You can group and filter information in Explorer to focus on items that are relevant to you and that require action\. When you identify high priority issues, you can use OpsCenter to run Automation runbooks and quickly resolve those issues\. 

If you already set up OpsCenter, you still need to complete Integrated Setup to verify settings and options\. If you haven't set up OpsCenter, then you can use Integrated Setup to get started with both capabilities\. For more information, see [Getting started with Systems Manager Explorer and OpsCenter](Explorer-setup.md)\.

**Note**  
Integrated Setup is only available in the AWS Systems Manager console\. You can't set up Explorer and OpsCenter programmatically\.
