# Creating a runbook using the Editor<a name="automation-document-editor"></a>

If the AWS Systems Manager public runbooks don't perform all the actions you want to perform on your AWS resources, you can create your own runbooks\. For example, you can use the editor to modify parameters, add additional steps to an existing runbook, or combine multiple runbooks into a single runbook\. If you're familiar with writing your own runbooks in JSON or YAML, you can use the editor to enter the JSON or YAML runbook content\.

For examples of custom runbooks, see [Sample scenarios and custom runbook solutions](automation-document-samples.md)\.

**Note**  
If your runbook uses the `aws:executeScript` automation action with the `Attachment` input parameter, you must use the AWS CLI or Document Builder to successfully create the runbook\.

The following procedure describes how to use the editor to create a runbook\.
